        <div class="tip">
            <button type="button"> Don't overcrowd the pan.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>You might think you have enough room in your skillet for an extra piece of chicken, but if it’s questionable, don’t risk it. There’s a chance the heat won’t distribute properly to the rest of the food in the pan, thus affecting flavor or, worse, creating a health risk. As a preventative measure, leave a few inches between each item to ensure they cook thoroughly.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Let red meat sit before cutting into it.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>Even a well-done steak should never taste dry. To prevent a steak from losing its juicy interior, place it directly on top of aluminum foil after taking it off the stove or grill. Carefully wrap the steak in the foil and let it sit for approximately five minutes. This allows the juices to settle before you cut into the meat. The meat will continue to cook while it is in the foil so if you prefer medium steak, you should take it off when it's medium rare.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Store spices in the right location.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>To prolong the life of your spices, keep them in a cool, dark place. Don’t store them on top of the stove, as heat and humidity can alter their flavor.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Shut the stove off before eggs are done.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>The trick to great eggs is to not overcook them! Whether you scramble, fry, or poach, always turn off the stove a few minutes before the eggs look done—even when they seem a bit runny. The remainder of the heat will cook them to fluffy perfection.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Chop herbs with salt.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>To prevent herbs from flying all over the place when chopping, sprinkle a bit of salt onto the board. This will keep them in place.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Add salt to boiling pasta water.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>When you make pasta, salting boiling water will add flavor from the inside out. The rule is about 1-2 tablespoons for a large pot of water, stir it until it dissolves, and once boiling, add pasta. It sounds simple (and it is!), but it will elevate the taste of your dish.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Use pasta water to create a pasta sauce.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>If you thought your pasta tasted good before, wait until you try this trick. Before dumping used pasta water, add a cup of it to your sauce pan. Then, add the pasta directly into the skillet. The salty water will add more flavor to your dish. Reserved pasta water also contains starch that can be used to adjust the consistency of sauce. </p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Use a paper towel to preserve vegetables.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>It never feels good to throw away food you haven’t touched, especially produce. Prolong the life of vegetables by wrapping them loosely in a dry paper towel and placing them in a re-sealable plastic bag. Oxygen is not a friend of veggies, so get as much air out of containers and bags before sealing. Also, avoid washing until you are ready to eat produce. And make sure to leave ample room in your refrigerator and produce drawer. Overstocking can cause less air to flow through the refrigerator, which can cause uneven temps with food expiring faster.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button">Keep the root of the onion intact to help with slicing.</button>
            <div class="techniqueDetail">
                <p>Onions can be difficult to slice into without making a mess. To cut them evenly, do not remove the root. While keeping it intact, peel the onion and slice in a horizontal direction. Then, cut down vertically to create perfectly minced pieces.</p>
